    "The main characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "1. Ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered, which means they have a specific position or index within the tuple.\n",

    "              However, it is possible to create a new tuple by concatenating or slicing the original tuple.\n",
    "3. Heterogeneous: A tuple can contain elements of different data types, including other tuples.\n",
    "4. Indexed: Each element in a tuple has a unique index starting from zero, which can be used to access the element.\n",
    "5. Iterable: A tuple can be used in a for loop or other iterable contexts, where each element can be accessed sequentially.\n",
