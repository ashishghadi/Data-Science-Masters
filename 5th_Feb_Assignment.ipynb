    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has its own state (i.e., data) and behavior (i.e., methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a class named \"Car\" which has attributes like \"make\", \"model\", \"color\", and \"speed\", and methods like \"accelerate\", \"decelerate\", \"turn_left\", and \"turn_right\". This class defines the blueprint for a car object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we create two instances of this class, they will be two different objects with their own set of attributes and methods. For example, we could create a car object named \"my_car\" with attributes \"make\"=\"Toyota\", \"model\"=\"Corolla\", \"color\"=\"red\", and \"speed\"=100. We could then use the methods of this object to make it accelerate, decelerate, turn_left, and turn_right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we could create another car object named \"your_car\" with attributes \"make\"=\"Ford\", \"model\"=\"Mustang\", \"color\"=\"blue\", and \"speed\"=150, and use its methods to manipulate its state.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal data and functionality of an object from the outside world and allowing access to it only through a well-defined interface. It helps to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class, inheriting the properties and methods of the existing class. It allows code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, as long as they implement the same interface or inherit from the same superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of defining a simplified representation of a complex system. It allows us to focus on the essential features of an object, ignoring the non-essential details. This helps to reduce complexity and improve readability of the code."
